zendust.el
=========

_Zendust_ is a low-saturation, light-background version of zenburn.

I dislike the highly contrasting colors of most color-themes because
while they are excellent for highlighting different syntactic elements
of source code files, they are also tiring when I am trying to
concentrate on the semantics. For zendust, I tried to use the least
contrast that I need to distinguish between syntactic elements, say, a
keyword from a variable.

Also, certain elements, such as comments and parentheses, are
intentionally pushed towards the background so that they are almost
unnoticable unless you are looking for them.

Finally, there are many parts of emacs that I don't use, so some of
the fonts might be inappropriate or plain ugly.
